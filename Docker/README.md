## What is Docker?

- Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

## What is Containerisation?

- Containerisation is a type of virtualisation in which all the components of an application are bundled into a single container image and can be run in isolated user space on the same shared operating system. Containers are lightweight, portable, and highly conducive to automation.

- Computer software covers the maximum, i.e. 40%, followed by IT services, i.e. 17%. While Staffing and Recruiting industry is 10%. This is followed by Internet (7%), Healthcare (6%), Financial Services (6%), Computer Hardware (5%), Retail (4%), Consulting (3%), and Telecommunications (2%).

## Benefits of Containerisation and Docker?

- Able to run anywhere - Containers can run anywhere, as long as the container engine supports the underlying operating system—it is possible to run containers on Linux, Windows, MacOS, and many other operating systems. Containers can run in virtual machines, on bare metal servers, locally on a developer’s laptop. They can easily be moved between on-premise machines and public cloud, and across all these environments, continue to work consistently.

- Speed - Containers are a lightweight package that everything needed to run, including its own operating system, code, dependencies, and libraries. 
You create a container image and then deploy a container in a matter of seconds. Once you have the image set up, you can quickly replicate containers and easily and quickly deploy as needed. Destroying a container is also a matter of seconds.The lightweight design of containers ensures that you can quickly release new applications and upgrades like bug fixes and new features. This often leads to a quicker development process and speeds up the time to market as well as operational tasks.

## Virtualisation vs Containerisation

- Containers and virtual machines are very similar resource virtualisation technologies. Virtualisation is the process in which a system singular resource like RAM, CPU, Disk, or Networking can be ‘virtualised’ and represented as multiple resources. The key differentiator between containers and virtual machines is that virtual machines virtualise an entire machine down to the hardware layers and containers only virtualise software layers above the operating system level.


## Interview Answers

What is Docker? 
- Docker is a containerization platform which packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers so as to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment, be it development, test or production. It wraps basically anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

What is Containerisation?
- Essentially, an application that is being developed and deployed is bundled and wrapped together with all its configuration files and dependencies. This bundle is called a container. When you wish to run the application on another system, the container is deployed which will give a bug-free environment as all the dependencies and libraries are wrapped together.


Who uses it?

- Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled. Containers support agile and DevOps efforts to accelerate development, test, and production cycles. A large number of the Cloud and IT industry use containerisation. 

Benefits of Containerisation and Docker?

- Fast
- Can run anywhere
- Highly Scalable
- Can run multiple containers on same server 


Virtualisation vs Containerisation 

- Containers provide an isolated environment for running applications. The entire used space can be dedicated to a single application, Compared to VMs, hypervisors provide you with an entire VM to the guest (including the kernel). Virtual machines are essentially an abstraction of the hardware layer and each VM is a physical machine.
