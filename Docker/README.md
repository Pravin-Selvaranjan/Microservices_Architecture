## What is Docker?

- Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Learn about containers, how they compare to VMs, and why Docker is so widely adopted and used.

## What is Containerisation?

- Containerisation is a type of virtualisation in which all the components of an application are bundled into a single container image and can be run in isolated user space on the same shared operating system. Containers are lightweight, portable, and highly conducive to automation.

## Who uses it?

- Computer software covers the maximum, i.e. 40%, followed by IT services, i.e. 17%. While Staffing and Recruiting industry is 10%. This is followed by Internet (7%), Healthcare (6%), Financial Services (6%), Computer Hardware (5%), Retail (4%), Consulting (3%), and Telecommunications (2%).

## Benefits of Containerisation and Docker?

- Able to run anywhere - Containers can run anywhere, as long as the container engine supports the underlying operating system—it is possible to run containers on Linux, Windows, MacOS, and many other operating systems. Containers can run in virtual machines, on bare metal servers, locally on a developer’s laptop. They can easily be moved between on-premise machines and public cloud, and across all these environments, continue to work consistently.

- Speed - Containers are a lightweight package that everything needed to run, including its own operating system, code, dependencies, and libraries. 
You create a container image and then deploy a container in a matter of seconds. Once you have the image set up, you can quickly replicate containers and easily and quickly deploy as needed. Destroying a container is also a matter of seconds.The lightweight design of containers ensures that you can quickly release new applications and upgrades like bug fixes and new features. This often leads to a quicker development process and speeds up the time to market as well as operational tasks.

## Virtualisation vs Containerisation

- Containers and virtual machines are very similar resource virtualization technologies. Virtualization is the process in which a system singular resource like RAM, CPU, Disk, or Networking can be ‘virtualized’ and represented as multiple resources. The key differentiator between containers and virtual machines is that virtual machines virtualize an entire machine down to the hardware layers and containers only virtualize software layers above the operating system level.
